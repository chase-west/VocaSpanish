# VocaSpanish - Spanish Vocabulary Practice App
VocaSpanish is a Python application designed to enhance your Spanish vocabulary through the use of voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. I personally built this app because I wanted to be able to multitask while learning my spanish vocabulary for class. 

# How it works
1. The app reads to you a vocab word based off of a dictonary of vocabulary keys.
2. You verbally answer with the correct vocab word. 
3. The app compares your answer with the correct one and returns if you are right or wrong.
